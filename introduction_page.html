                <p> &nbsp; &nbsp;  My name is Ana Bindiu! I am a third year computer science student at University of Calgary. I was born in Romania in a small city called <br> Arad. Growing up, I learned to love to think analytically as I was fascinated by the challenges I took in my math classes. My family is full of artists, <br> my parents being interior designers, with my sister following in their footsteps. Despite that, I always knew my career in life would be different <br> than that. I've always loved analyzing everything around me, from detecting patterns in my life to interpreting information around me to taking <br> decisions about which action to take next. My fascination with technology started when I was young, as I became curious to know how things <br>in a computer work. Unfortunately, as I grew older, despite my constant love for analytical thinking and technology, I felt lonely as a female in <br>that kind of field. Due to societal standards, I then prioritized more feminine likes such as biology and chemistry and hoped for a different future. <br> Moving to Canada in 2014, I worked towards my goal at the time of becoming a doctor. As I finished high school, I started college at Mount Royal <br> University, studying chemistry. After my first semester, I had a strong gut feeling that what I was studying was not meant to be for me. Talking to <br> multiple people in my life, a lot of people suggested I try a few computer science courses. In my second semester at Mount Royal University, I took <br> a full course load of computer science courses with the hope I'd fit in. Despite the fact that I was one of the 4 girls in my classes, I knew this was <br>something I wanted to do. A few months later I got accepted at University of Calgary and decided to follow this path. Though computer science <br> courses were very challenging to me in my first year of college, I am proud to say I am in my third year of computer science now feeling more <br> achieved than ever. I am very proud of the progress I've done and the amount of things I've learned. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; I am very proud of the computer scientists out there and the solutions they've come up with for diverse technological problems and the <br> amount of technological growth there has been due to the relentless problem solving of computer scientists out there. I hope to be one of those <br> computer scientists who helps solve problems around the world and I want to gain all the knowledge needed to do that! I also want to be an <br> encourager to women out there who have a passion for this type of field and feel as though they don't fit in!

Adding onto that, I love teamwork and working on projects with other people. I also love leading and helping people in projects that I work on with them and also just in general! I try to make sure people around me enjoy their time as much as possible! Furthermore, I love doing things out of my comfort zone as it goes a long way in terms of my personal development. This helps improve my creativity and learning process in the long run. </p>
